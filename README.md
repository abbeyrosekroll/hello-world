# hello-world
My very first repository - Eek!

I'm currently based in Auckland, New Zealand where I am a designer / developer of all things web related!  I love my job and where I live, but it's time for an exciting change.

Shortly I'm moving to Palmerston North.  It's a small town just south of central North Island, New Zealand.  I was actually born there so returning "home" to family and friends is rather exciting.  

Along with moving comes finding a new job... which is challenging in this field but keep your fingers crossed for an update on this soon!
